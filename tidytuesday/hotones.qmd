title: "Hot Ones Episodes TidyTuesday"
jupyter: python3

```{python}
import numpy as np
import polars as pl
import seaborn as sns

```

read in the data

```{python}
episodes = pl.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-08-08/episodes.csv"
)

episodes.shape
```

```{python}
episodes.head()
```

So the most important thing here is to see how many people didn't finish and who they are

```{python}
no_finish = episodes.filter(pl.col("finished") == False)

no_finish.shape[0]
```

ok, so 15 people didn't finish...let's see who they are

```{python}
 no_finish['guest'].to_list()
```

I'm pretty disappointed that Chance and Pusha are on this list.
