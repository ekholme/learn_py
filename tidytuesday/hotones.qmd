title: "Hot Ones Episodes TidyTuesday"
jupyter: python3
---

```{python}
import numpy as np
import polars as pl
import seaborn as sns

```

read in the data

```{python}
episodes = pl.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-08-08/episodes.csv",
    null_values='NA'
)

episodes.shape
```

```{python}
episodes.head()
```

So the most important thing here is to see how many people didn't finish and who they are

```{python}
no_finish = episodes.filter(pl.col("finished") == False)

no_finish.shape[0]
```

ok, so 15 people didn't finish...let's see who they are

```{python}
 no_finish['guest'].to_list()
```

I'm pretty disappointed that Chance and Pusha are on this list.

Ok, so let's see how many episodes there are by season

```{python}
season_ep_counts = episodes.groupby('season', maintain_order=True).count() 

season_ep_counts
```

Ok, so earlier seasons had more episodes (aside from s1). Let's plot this

```{python}
#probably want to coerce season to categorical
s_cat_counts = season_ep_counts.with_columns(pl.col('season').cast(pl.Utf8))

sns.barplot(
    s_cat_counts.to_pandas(),
    x='season', 
    y='count',
    color='steelblue'
) 
```

Which guests have appeared multiple times?

```{python}
mult_appear = episodes.groupby('guest').count().filter(pl.col('count') > 1) 

mult_appear.shape
```

Ok, so 12 people have been on multiple times.

I'm also seeing 2 `null` entries, so let's see if the title for those tell us anything. Maybe they're solo episodes with Sean, so there isn't a guest?

```{python}
episodes.filter(pl.col('guest').is_null())['title'].to_list() 
```

Ok, so these are holiday specials. That makes sense.

I think this one is done enough? There's not all that much more I'm interested in here.
