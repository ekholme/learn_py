```{python}
import numpy as np
import polars as pl
import seaborn as sns
```

read in data

```{python}
detectors = pl.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-07-18/detectors.csv', null_values="NA") 

detectors.shape
```

```{python}
 detectors.head()
```

get a list of distinct detectors

```{python}
detectors['detector'].unique() 
```

ok, so there are 7 distinct detectors in the dataset. But let's count to see which are represented more

```{python}
detector_counts =  detectors.groupby('detector').count()

detector_counts
```

Ok so most are eventaly represented -- sapling and quil have slightly fewer. My guess is that this is from 2 difference experiments.

Next let's see which models are correct most often

```{python}
correct_df = detectors.with_columns(
    correct = pl.col('kind') == pl.col('.pred_class')
) 

correct_df.head()

correct_df_summed = correct_df.groupby('detector').agg(pl.col('correct').mean().alias('pct_correct'))

correct_df_summed
```

and let's plot this with seaborn

```{python}
sns.catplot(
    data = correct_df_summed.to_pandas(),
    kind = "bar",
    x = "detector",
    y = "pct_correct",
    color = "steelblue"
) 
```

And let's look at the distribution of the predicted probability for native vs non-native speakers

```{python}
native_complete = detectors.filter(
    pl.col('native').is_not_null()
)

sns.displot(
    data = native_complete,
    x = '.pred_AI',
    col = 'native',
    facet_kws=dict(sharey = False)
)
```

Yikes, so writings by native speakers are almost never classified as being written by AI, but those written by non-native speakers are much more likely to be so.
